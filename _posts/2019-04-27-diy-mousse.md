So aftering reading about the various forcemeats in an old culinary textbook after I graduated from college about 10 years ago, I finally have had a success making one thanks to Julia Child's recipe for chicken liver mousse!

My last attempt at a forcemeat was deer + deer liver pate, but it wound up being spiced completely wrong because while I knew rosemary and juniper would be great on venison, I failed to use a correct amount of salt and pepper, and it wound up being kinda bitter and bland after I did all the work of cooking it...

I'm told pressing the blended mixture through a sieve is like the key to not having rubbery bits from the cooked liver. It'll make sure any bile ducts you weren't able to separate or were too lazy to separate out doesn't make it into the final mousse.
