After about 9 or so months, I'm nearing bottling time for my skeeter pee batches. The lemon wine with cherries is bone dry and smells of lightly of acetone. The oaked lemon wine stalled while still fairly sweet and is much more pleasant to drink.

The cherry one finished at a bone dry 0.988 final gravity, and the oaked one finished at 1.005 specific gravity. Having been 5 gallon batches with 12 lbs of table sugar added, the cherry one at least 15.8% ABV and the oaked skeeter pee is upwards of 13.7% ABV. I failed to take an original gravity reading because I had assumed that the added table sugar was the bulk of the fermentables, but I realized after a couple weeks into the fermentation that meyer lemons are noticeably sweet and must have contributed to the sugar content at least a bit.
