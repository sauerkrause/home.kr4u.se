So, yes, I'm still alive. I've got some green onions basically ready to harvest. I have a ton of basil growing (thai, sweet and holy). My peppers I've grown from seed are finally producing buds which may eventually bloom and fruit, but it will probably not bear fruit until after I'm gone and in China. They came from some peppers I bought probably around the time I moved to Dallas, but I froze them to use them later and then they got buried in the freezer and forgotten. I pulled some seeds out, soaked them in water and planted them. I gave up expecting them to grow after about 3 weeks and planted some of my basil cuttings in their pots. Then magically a few weeks after that, I managed to get 4 sprouts. They were labeled as fresh chile de árbol, but they do not look like other peppers I've purchased that were also labeled as fresh de árbol. I suspect they are just thai chilis which will be great if they ever produce.

Also my habanero plant is pretty much not going to produce any more fruit. I overwatered it, made it really sick, then gave it so much light it couldn't draw nutrients out of the soil fast enough that it got even sicker, and none of its flowers ever successfully pollinate anymore and instead simply rot and/or drop off instead of setting fruit. I suspect it's blossom rot but I've tried nutrient sprays to counter it and it doesn't work. I'm going to just assume it got some sort of fungal blight due to overwatering. If it produces even one more fruit any time soon, I'll be shocked. Until I screwed everything up, it was doing really well and actually blooming and I got about 12 fruits before it nearly died.

My thai hot ornamental (which is only an ornamental because the peppers are so tiny and annoying to chop) was producing really well until I repotted it and accidentally overwatered it.

One of the presumable thai chiles grew pretty tall and was looking great until the pequin plant my parents gave me decided to develop mealybugs and I found one on this thai plant and had to quarantine both of them while I attempt to treat the infestation.

This is the evil pequin plant my parents gave me that attempted to kill my other plants.

And the basil's doing lovely outside and pulling in some nice pollinators and possibly some bugs to help eat those mealybugs.
