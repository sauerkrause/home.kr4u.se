Hello world! This is my first blog post. Last week, I made a fermented chickpea cheese. Lessons I should have learned though:
- Blend agar in with the chickpeas if I want it to help hold it together
  * It settles to the bottom if I don't.
- Find a better way to drain cheese. Tofu mold or hanging would have worked
  * Just using cheesecloth in the fridge didn't dry it out as much as online bloggers claim.

The consistency wound up being a bit too hummus-y.
