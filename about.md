I'm Robert Krause (callsign KR4USE). In the daytime, I mostly hack on android and a bit of hardware integration for Zebra Technologies. Outside of work, I enjoy all sorts of aspects of DIY. I occasionally get on the air on amateur radio. I brew wine, mead and formerly beer. Occasionally I do some food ferments such as cheese, lacto-fermented pickles, natto, yogurt, etc. Very rarely, I delve into writing code for personal projects such as implementing neat projects in languages never really built for them, but I do work from home and try to keep a work-life balance where possible. The less code I touch at home, the less my personal life feels like work.

I've been in the process of going back and cataloguing the various weird crap I've made / done, so I decided what better time than the present to get this blog up and running.
